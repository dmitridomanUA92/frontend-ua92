# Reflection

## What Went Well
- I maintained consistent branding and accessibility across all pages.
- The colour palette, typography, and layout follow the brand guide closely.
- User feedback directly shaped the design decisions, such as the dark mode and simplified navigation.

## What Could Be Improved
- Commit history could be more structured with clearer commit messages.
- Some responsiveness tweaks were done late and could be planned earlier.
- Theme persistence (saving user mode preference) can be implemented in future updates.

## Lessons Learned
- How version control helps track progress and maintain project integrity.
- The importance of accessibility from the start of a project.
- Using testing tools like Lighthouse improved my understanding of real-world performance issues.

## Future Development
- Add localStorage for theme preference persistence.
- Introduce blog post categorisation and search.
- Explore a CMS backend or static site generator integration.

## Summary
This project taught me how to plan, design, and implement a small front-end website using professional practices. I improved my understanding of HTML, CSS, accessibility, and GitHub workflows while producing a consistent and accessible brand identity.
