# Elicitation Notes 
## How I gathered feedback
I've discussed with 3 people and looked at a few small tech blogs for inspiration.
I asked what draws them to a particular tech blog when looking at web design or code.

## Feedback
- People enjoy concise summaries before committing to a longer detailed article.
- Code should be clear and visible
- Light/Dark Mode and a clean UI preferred
- Navigation is more of a priority than animation

  ## Derived Requirements
  1. Articles should include a short concise summary
  2. High contrast + readable fonts
  3. Navigation should be easy and clear
  4. Website must include light and dark themes

  ## Summary
  These notes helped me plan the layout and features for HTMLemon.
