# Elicitation Notes 

## How I gathered feedback
I conducted informal discussions and brief interviews with three individuals and reviewed several small tech blogs for inspiration. This approach helped me understand user preferences and industry standards related to web design and coding presentation.

## Feedback
- People prefer concise summaries before committing to reading a longer, detailed article, as it helps them quickly assess the content's relevance.
- Code examples should be clear and easily visible to enhance readability and comprehension.
- Users favor Light/Dark Mode options combined with a clean and uncluttered user interface to reduce eye strain and improve usability.
- Navigation is considered a higher priority than animations because users want to find information quickly and efficiently without distractions.

## Derived Requirements
1. Articles should include a short, concise summary to provide users with a quick overview and help them decide whether to read further. This improves content accessibility and user engagement.
2. The website must feature high contrast and readable fonts to ensure that all text, especially code, is easy to read for users with varying visual abilities.
3. Navigation should be easy and clear to enable users to find information quickly, minimizing frustration and improving overall user experience.
4. The website must support both light and dark themes to accommodate different user preferences and environments, enhancing comfort and accessibility.

## Summary
These insights have directly informed the design and feature set of HTMLemon, ensuring a user-centered approach. By prioritizing clear summaries, readable code, intuitive navigation, and customizable themes, HTMLemon aims to deliver an accessible and engaging experience tailored to the needs of its audience.
